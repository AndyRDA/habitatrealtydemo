  Welcome to this immaculate 3-bedroom "Home in the Sky" — a rare gem perched on the 6th floor of this well-maintained block. Spanning an impressive 160m², this spacious apartment offers uninterrupted views of Table Mountain to the west and the majestic Drakenstein Mountains to the east. Flooded with natural light and designed for comfortable, elevated living, this is a unique opportunity to secure a truly special space in the sky.

  This expansive home offers two living rooms, a well-appointed kitchen with a separate scullery, and three generously sized bedrooms with ample built-in cupboard space. A sunny patio off the lounge is perfect for relaxing and can easily be enclosed to create a versatile all-weather space.

  The main bedroom features exceptional views, ample cupboards, and a private ensuite bathroom. Secure parking includes a single garage and two dedicated undercover bays, plus additional visitor parking is available. The apartment is ideally located next to Kingsbury Hospital and close to Cavendish Square and top schools. Small pets are allowed with permission from the Body Corporate.
